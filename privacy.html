  <h2>Instee LLC - Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains the information that Instee LLC (“Instee,” “we,” or “us”) collect about users of the Instee mobile application, how we use that information, and with whom we share it. If we make any material changes to our privacy practices, we will post a revised Privacy Policy on this page. If you have any questions, please contact us by sending an email to <a href ="mailto:support@insteeapp.com">support@insteeapp.com.</a> </p>

  <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
  <p>Information collected automatically: When you use Instee, we automatically collect and store the following information from your device:</p>
      <p>• Instagram Profile Information</p>

      <p>• Your mobile device's geographic location while the app is actively running</p>

  <h4>Information you choose to provide:</h4>
  <p>In order to register, you will be asked to sign-in using your Instagram login. If you do so, you authorize us to access your Instagram account information. By allowing us to access this information, you can build your Instee profile and we can prevent you from seeing people you are already following on Instagram.<br>

  Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable screens or pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.<br>

  Any image, video or information you provide may be publicly displayed. If you wish, we will delete your account information.
